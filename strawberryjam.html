    <p>Easy to make, homemade strawberry jam with extra tips for using frozen strawberries, what to do if you don’t have a sugar thermometer and what to do if your jam doesn’t set.</p>
      
    <p>HJam-making is one of those things that remind my of my childhood, or more specifically visiting my grandparents down in Devon. They lived up in the hills on the edge of a village and had a big garden full of homegrown goodies. At breakfast and tea time there was always a jar of homemade jam on the table whipped up by my Granny from something they’d grown (or blackberries we’d picked from along the lane). My absolute favourite was my Granny’s bramble jelly, made with apples and blackberries. I have a pile of her old cookbooks upstairs and I really need to go through and hunt out that particular recipe, as I’d love to try making it myself.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>700 g strawberries</li>
        <li>700 g jam sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice/li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Equipment:
        <li>Medium saucepan</li>
        <li>Wooden spoon</li>
        <li>Sugar thermometer - you can still make jam without one </li>
        <li>Jars</li>
        <li>Jam Funnel - not essential but it's much easier to get the jam into the jars without getting sticky if you have one</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a medium-sized saucepan over a low heat and once the pan is hot add the strawberries (700g). Fry for a couple of minutes, stirring regularly, and then add the jam sugar (700g) and lemon juice (2 tsp).</li>
        <li>Stir all of the ingredients together. Continue stirring until all of the sugar has dissolved - you can tell if the sugar has dissolved by dipping a spoon in and looking at the back to see if any grains have stuck to it.</li>
        <li>Once all of the sugar has dissolved, turn up the heat to medium/high. Let the jam bubble until it reaches 105ºC - make sure you move your thermometer around a bit to ensure it's all at the right temperature.</li>
        <li>SOnce your jam has reached 105ºC pour it into sterilised jars (if using) and leave to set.
                    </li>
        <li>Bon appetite!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>This recipe can be adapted for however many strawberries you have to use up. Simply use equal quantities (by weight) of strawberries with the stalks removed and jam sugar. You can add lemon juice to taste, but as a rough guide use ¼ tsp of lemon juice per 100g of fruit.</p>
    <p>If you're planning on storing your jam for more than a couple of days then you should sterilise your jars before putting in the jam. There's great guide on BBC Good Food on how to do this, alternatively you can purchase kits like this one that mean you don't need to handle hot jars.</p>
