        <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <p>This baked mac and cheese is a family favorite recipe, loved by both children and adults. It uses a combination of cheeses, layered in the dish as well as melted into a rich and creamy cheese sauce, for the ultimate in cheesy deliciousness!  Perfect for a comforting dinner or as a holiday side dish!</p>
      
    <p>It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
        <li>While water is coming up to a boil, grate cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles.  Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.  Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Top with 1 1/2 cups of grated cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chef tips:</h4>
    <p>To get the 4 cups of cheddar, use a 16 oz block of cheddar and shred. </p>
    <p>To get the 2 cups of gruyere, use as close to an 8 oz block of gruyere as you can (different brands have different sized blocks), and shred.</p>
